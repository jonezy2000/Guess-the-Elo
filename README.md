# Guess-the-Elo
 
 This project aims to allow chess players to get other players' elo ratings!
 
 ## **Development Roadmap** (subject to change)
 
 ### 1. Basic Functionality:
 - *Passable* front end design
 - Chessboard loads games from PGN file. User can go through the chess game and then guess the average elo of the two players
 - User has a rating for how good they guess the elos
 - Database of users, chess games
 
### 2. Leaderboards
 - Highest rated users (maybe top 10?) are presented on a seperate tab with details such as games guessed, win percentage, rating, username, etc
 
### 3. Stat-tracking
 - Seperate tab for viewing your own stats. Similar to the leaderboard stats but more will be avaialble
 
### 4. Multiplayer and beyond.... ;)
