# Guess-the-Elo
 
 This project aims to allow chess players to get other players' elo ratings!
 
 
 This project uses:
 - Python and [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) to handle the server side
 - [**Chess.js**](https://chessboardjs.com/) to handle the chess board
 
 
 
 ## **Development Roadmap** (subject to change)
 
 ### 1. Basic Functionality:
- *Passable* front end design
- Chessboard loads games from PGN file. User can go through the chess game and then guess the average elo of the two players
- User has a rating for how good they guess the elos
- Database of users, chess games

### 2. Leaderboards
 - Highest rated users (maybe top 10?) are presented on a seperate tab with details such as games guessed, win percentage, rating, username, etc
 
### 3. Stat-tracking
 - Seperate tab for viewing your own stats. Similar to the leaderboard stats but more will be avaialble
 - Allow users to mark a game as funny to view later
 - Add history of games you've guessed. 
 
### 4. User-Submitted Mode
- Allow users to submit games and other users can view and guess elo. Add ratings / comments? 


### 5. Multiplayer and beyond.... ;)
